# ART-ificial AI Art Generator App!

_NOTE_ - The deployed app is currently in read only mode as Azure Functions: Version 4 of the Node.js programming model is in preview, meaning you can only see the images I have generated from localhost environment. So, I have provided a video of the app below running on localhost to display full functionality.
